## _Keep it pumping_ idea

- **Goal:** pick up heart sections to keep your heart pumping
- top down isometric 3rd person (camera follow character in 1st prototype)
- you're inside the heart and have to bring back heart sections to the middle
- heart sections can be access through veins
- some enemies are blocking the veins
- 2 actions: attack (sword), guard (shield)
- life w/ hearts
